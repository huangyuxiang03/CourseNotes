# Course Notes at THU

These are some course notes I've taken while learning at Dept. of CST of THU.

Following records are organizeds as `<Abbreviation>: <Course name>, <Semester>, Prof. <Professor> (<Department>)`.

- DSA: Data Structure and Algorithms, 2022 Fall, Prof. Deng (CST)

- PS: Probability and Statistics, 2023 Spring, Prof. Liang (MATH)

- IAI: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, 2023 Spring, Prof. Ma (CST)

More notes are comming soon... I prefer to note with LaTeX on some maths courses and math-related cs courses.
